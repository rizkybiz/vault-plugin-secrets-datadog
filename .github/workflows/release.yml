# DEPRECATED: This workflow is being replaced by release-please.yml
# This GitHub action can publish assets for release when a tag is created.
# Currently its setup to run on any tag that matches the pattern "v*" (ie. v0.1.0).
#
# NOTE: release-please.yml now handles automated releases. This workflow will
# still trigger on manual tag pushes as a fallback.
